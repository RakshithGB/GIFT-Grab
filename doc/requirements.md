# Required tools and libraries

This document lists the tools and libraries needed for building and installing GIFT-Grab.
Please note that only a small subset of all listed items is a required dependency.
The majority of the listed items are needed only when a [specific GIFT-Grab feature][gg-features] is activated.


## Operating system

GIFT-Grab has so far been tested only on Linux:

* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, kernel: 3.19.0-59-generic
* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, kernel: 4.4.0-72-generic (**experimental:** please see the [known issues and limitations][gg-issues])
* Debian 9 (testing), kernel: 4.9.0-2-amd64 (**only** [the reading, writing of video files, and NumPy / SciPy compatibility][gg-features] tested)

[gg-issues]: issues.md
[gg-features]: ../README.md#features


## Build requirements

Building GIFT-Grab from source / installing GIFT-Grab via `pip` requires:

* A C++ compiler supporting C++11 (tested with GCC 4.9.3 on Ubuntu, 6.3.0 on Debian)
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/) (tested with 3.2 on Ubuntu, 3.7.2 on Debian)


## Optional requirements

**GIFT-Grab requires a subset of the following libraries based on activated [features][gg-features]**.
Please see the relevant link below for how to activate GIFT-Grab features:

* [Building GIFT-Grab from source][build-from-source] (C++ and Python)
* [Installing GIFT-Grab using `pip`][pip] (only Python)

[build-from-source]: build.md
[pip]: pypi.md

Please note that there are cross-dependencies between some of the optional dependencies.
Check out the [dependency installation guidelines][gg-tips] for details.

The parantheses in the version column mean that the listed version has been tested only on the platform within the respective parantheses.
